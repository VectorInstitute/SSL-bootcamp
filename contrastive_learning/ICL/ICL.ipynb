    "In this notebook, we will delve into the comprehensive exploration of the paper titled [\"Anomaly Detection for Tabular Data with Internal Contrastive Learning.\"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_hszZbt46bT) This paper introduces an innovative approach to anomaly detection by addressing the challenge of identifying out-of-class samples within tabular data, particularly when the data's structural characteristics are not well understood."

    "\n",
    "The image below illustrates how ICL masks a feature vector for contrastive learning. The underlying learning problem. Given a **sample vector** $x_i$, they consider the **subvector** $a_i^3$ and its **complementary** $b_i^3$. The networks are trained to produce similar embeddings for this pair of vectors, while distancing the embedding of $a_i^{j^{\\prime}}$ for $j^{\\prime} \\neq 3$ from that of $b_i^3$.\n",

    "The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve is a fundamental metric used to evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models. It provides insight into how well a model can distinguish between normal and anomalous instances across various threshold settings. AUC represents the degree or measure of separability calculated using ROC curves. It indicates how well the model can distinguish between classes. The higher the AUC, the better the model predicts 0 classes as 0 and 1 classes as 1. Below is a table that shows AUCROC values for different datasets."
