# Self-Supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection

Welcome to the Self-Supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection Bootcamp repository! This repository contains resources related to the bootcamp focusing on leveraging self-supervised learning techniques for anomaly detection, specifically targeting tabular data.

## Papers Covered

1. **Anomaly Detection for Tabular Data with Internal Contrastive Learning**
   This paper explores the application of internal contrastive learning for anomaly detection in tabular data. It discusses how self-supervised learning techniques can be employed to enhance anomaly detection performance, and it provides insights into the implementation and results.

2. **Latent Outlier Exposure for Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data**
   In this paper, the concept of latent outlier exposure for anomaly detection in the presence of contaminated data is discussed. The bootcamp session delves into the details of this approach, its advantages, and how it can be practically applied.

## Notebooks

In this repository, you will find two notebooks that correspond to the covered papers.
Feel free to explore, learn, and experiment with the notebooks. If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.
