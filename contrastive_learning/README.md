# Self-Supervised Learning with Contrastive Learning

This repository contains resources related to contrastive learning, with a focus on anomaly detection on tabular data.

## Papers Covered

1. **Anomaly Detection for Tabular Data with Internal Contrastive Learning**
   This paper explores the application of internal contrastive learning (ICL) for anomaly detection in tabular data. ICL learns to maximize the mutual information between two complementary subsets based on the assumption that the relation between a subset of features and the rest of the features is class-dependent.

2. **Latent Outlier Exposure for Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data**
   In this paper, the concept of latent outlier exposure (LOE) for anomaly detection in the presence of contaminated data is discussed. LOE extends ICL to work with contaminated datasets.

## Notebooks

In this repository, you will find two notebooks that correspond to the covered papers.
